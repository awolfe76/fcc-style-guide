# fcc-style-guide

This is the start of a style guide for the FCC.

Please use the issues section to request changes, or fork the repo and submit a pull request.

As is, the site will build using Jekyll. It also uses Sass for the CSS.

### Why?

There is currently no single "theme" for FCC websites and applications. This guide will provide that capability by giving guidelines, code snippets, and example usage.

*We are not using gh-pages at the moment to keep this from being public. In the future we can.*
